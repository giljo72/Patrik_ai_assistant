I have an anaconda env called Llava going
I run docker.desktop with qdrant_storage, local server
I run LMstudio with Llama 3 -13b but will probably change models around
I run Flask for the website.


Status 4/25
📚 Local AI Assistant Project Summary
🧩 Current Components:

Area	Status
Webpage (UI)	Built with Flask (base.html, index.html)
Styling (CSS)	Dark theme, yellow accents, ChatGPT-style chat
Front-end JS	Send messages, Typing indicator, File upload/Mic button placeholders
Memory Store	Qdrant + SentenceTransformer for text and images
Document Ingestion	store_incoming.py processes .txt, .docx, .images into memory
Backend Model	LM Studio running Llama 3 13B locally
Docker + Qdrant	Running locally via Docker Desktop
Anaconda Environment	llava environment active
🛠️ Major Functional Areas and Sub-Steps to Finish
1. Web Interface Polish

Sub-Step	Goal
🔹 Replace 📎 🎤 emoji buttons with local SVGs	Stock, locally hosted icons
🔹 Finalize chat input UX (press Enter/send button)	Done (already functional)
🔹 Add real scroll behavior to chat history	Easy CSS tweak
🔹 Clear placeholder text from index.html	Ready for production launch
2. File Upload (Attach Button 📎)

Sub-Step	Goal
🔹 Clicking 📎 opens file picker	Basic input[type='file']
🔹 Uploads file to F:/AI_documents/incoming/	Web server side save
🔹 Triggers store_incoming.py automatically or manually	Background process / button
3. Voice Input (Mic Button 🎤)

Sub-Step	Goal
🔹 Clicking 🎤 triggers Whisper model	(Local or backend Whisper API)
🔹 Converts speech to text	Autofills the chat input field
🔹 Sends as normal message	Just like typing manually
4. Memory Search (Backend RAG Integration)

Sub-Step	Goal
🔹 Chat input POSTs message to /chat	Done ✅
🔹 Server retrieves matching context from Qdrant	Done ✅ (retrieve_memory_context())
🔹 Constructs augmented prompt for LLM	(already in app.py)
🔹 Returns final LLM answer to user	Done ✅
5. File Manager (coming soon in Webpage)

Sub-Step	Goal
🔹 file_manager.html page for listing uploaded docs/images	
🔹 Delete, re-tag, and reprocess uploaded files	
🔹 Browse incoming/processed folder contents	
6. Backup, Organization, and Logs

Sub-Step	Goal
🔹 Regular backup of F:/AI_documents/processed/	
🔹 Organize processed/ into subfolders (Text, Spreadsheets, Images)	(future minor tweak)
🔹 Log all actions (_processing_log.txt)	Done ✅
📂 Clean Folder Structure

Path	Purpose
F:/Project_Files/Webpage/templates/	Flask HTML templates
F:/Project_Files/Webpage/static/css/	CSS styling
F:/Project_Files/Webpage/static/js/	Frontend logic
F:/Project_Files/Webpage/static/images/	Future SVGs/icons
F:/AI_documents/incoming/	New uploads
F:/AI_documents/processed/	Processed documents
F:/qdrant_storage/	Vector database
🚀 Critical Pieces for Fresh Chat Continuation
✅ Webpage architecture
✅ Chat system working
✅ Placeholder UI ready
✅ Qdrant vector storage active
✅ LM Studio model connected
✅ File processor store_incoming.py built

🧠 Suggested Fresh Chat Start Topics:
When we open the next chat, pick one logical area to work on, for example:

"Let’s replace the 📎 and 🎤 with real SVGs next."

"Let’s wire up the attach button to actually upload."

"Let’s begin planning the file manager screen."

Chunk by chunk — very cleanly.

🌟 You’re 85% there already.
The project is very professional and beautifully structured now.
